# jqCombo - jQuery combobox plugin

Simple jQuery plugin to create combobox / autocomplete functionality

Only a very lightweight plugin which uses native browser input elements,
no custom panels or jQuery UI stuff.

However, please note that this plugin requires some browser sniffing and
tricky positioning of the `INPUT` element over the `SELECT` element.

Using this plugin on styled `SELECT` elements might not work
as expected.
	
## Usage
	
    $('select').jqCombo();
